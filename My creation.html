             <h1><u>CAT</u></h1>
           <p>The cat (Felis catus) is a domestic species of small <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnivore">carnivorous animal</a>.[1][2] It is the only domesticated
              species in the family Felidae and is often referred to as the domestic cat to distinguish it from the wild members of the family.[4] A cat can either be a house
               cat, a farm cat or a feral cat; the latter ranges freely and avoids human contact.[5] Domestic cats are valued by humans for companionship and their ability to
                hunt rodents. About 60 cat breeds are recognized by various cat registries.[6]</p>
           <p>The cat is similar in anatomy to the other felid species: it has a strong flexible body, quick reflexes, sharp teeth and retractable claws adapted
             to killing small prey. Its night vision and sense of smell are well developed. Cat communication includes vocalizations like meowing, purring, trilling,
             hissing, growling and grunting as well as cat-specific body language. It is a solitary hunter but a social species. It can hear sounds too faint or too high
              in frequency for human ears, such as those made by mice and other small mammals. It is a predator that is most active at dawn and dusk.[7] It secretes and
              perceives pheromones.[8]

              Female domestic cats can have kittens from spring to late autumn, with litter sizes ranging from two to five kittens.[9] Domestic cats are bred and shown
               at events as registered pedigreed cats, a hobby known as cat fancy. Failure to control breeding of pet cats by spaying and neutering, as well as abandonment
                of pets, resulted in large numbers of feral cats worldwide, contributing to the extinction of entire bird species and evoking population control.[10]

                Cats were first domesticated in the Near East around 7500 BC.[11] It was long thought that cat domestication was initiated in Ancient Egypt, as since around
                3100 BC veneration was given to cats in ancient Egypt.[12][13]

                As of 2017, the domestic cat was the second-most popular pet in the United States by number of pets owned, after freshwater fish,[14] with 95 million cats
                owned.[15][16] In the United Kingdom, around 7.3 million cats lived in more than 4.8 million households as of 2019.[17]</p>
          <h3><u>Etymology and naming</u></h3>
          <p>The origin of the English word 'cat', Old English catt, is thought to be the Late Latin word cattus, which was first used at the beginning of the 6th century.
            [18] It was suggested that the word 'cattus' is derived from an Egyptian precursor of Coptic ϣⲁⲩ šau, "tomcat", or its feminine form suffixed with -t.[19] The Late
            Latin word is also thought to be derived from Afro-Asiatic languages.[20] The Nubian word kaddîska "wildcat" and Nobiin kadīs are possible sources or cognates.[21]
            The Nubian word may be a loan from Arabic قَطّ‎ qaṭṭ ~ قِطّ qiṭṭ. It is "equally likely that the forms might derive from an ancient Germanic word, imported into Latin
            and thence to Greek and to Syriac and Arabic".[22] The word may be derived from Germanic and Northern European languages, and ultimately be borrowed from Uralic,
             cf. Northern Sami gáđfi, "female stoat", and Hungarian hölgy, "stoat"; from Proto-Uralic *käďwä, "female (of a furred animal)".[23]

            The English puss, extended as pussy and pussycat, is attested from the 16th century and may have been introduced from Dutch poes or from Low German puuskatte, related to
            Swedish kattepus, or Norwegian pus, pusekatt. Similar forms exist in Lithuanian puižė and Irish puisín or puiscín. The etymology of this word is unknown, but it may have
             simply arisen from a sound used to attract a cat.[24][25]

            A male cat is called a tom or tomcat[26] (or a gib,[27] if neutered) An unspayed female is called a queen,[28] especially in a cat-breeding context. A juvenile cat is
             referred to as a kitten. In Early Modern English, the word kitten was interchangeable with the now-obsolete word catling.[29] A group of cats can be referred to as a
              clowder or a glaring.[30]</p>
          <h3><u>Taxonomy</u></h3>
          <p>The scientific name Felis catus was proposed by Carl Linnaeus in 1758 for a domestic cat.[1][2] Felis catus domesticus was proposed by Johann Christian Polycarp
            Erxleben in 1777.[3] Felis daemon proposed by Konstantin Alekseevich Satunin in 1904 was a black cat from the Transcaucasus, later identified as a domestic cat.
            [31][32]
            In 2003, the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature ruled that the domestic cat is a distinct species, namely Felis catus.[33][34] In 2007, it was
            considered a subspecies of the European wildcat, F. silvestris catus, following results of phylogenetic research.[35][36] In 2017, the IUCN Cat Classification
             Taskforce followed the recommendation of the ICZN in regarding the domestic cat as a distinct species, Felis catus.[37</p>
             <h3><u>Evolution</u></h3>
             <p>The domestic cat is a member of the Felidae, a family that had a common ancestor about 10–15 million years ago.[38] The genus Felis diverged from the Felidae
               around 6–7 million years ago.[39] Results of phylogenetic research confirm that the wild Felis species evolved through sympatric or parapatric speciation, whereas
                the domestic cat evolved through artificial selection.[40] The domesticated cat and its closest wild ancestor are both diploid organisms that possess 38
                 chromosomes[41] and roughly 20,000 genes.[42] The leopard cat (Prionailurus bengalensis) was tamed independently in China around 5500 BC. This line of partially
                  domesticated cats leaves no trace in the domestic cat populations of today.[43]</p>
                  <h3><u>Domestication</u></h3>
                  <p>The earliest known indication for the taming of an African wildcat (F. lybica) was excavated close by a human Neolithic grave in Shillourokambos,
                    southern Cyprus, dating to about 9,200 to 9,500 years before present. As there is no evidence of native mammalian fauna on Cyprus, the inhabitants
                     of this Neolithic village most likely brought the cat and other wild mammals to the island from the Middle Eastern mainland.[44] Scientists therefore
                      assume that African wildcats were attracted to early human settlements in the Fertile Crescent by rodents, in particular the house mouse (Mus musculus)
                      , and were tamed by Neolithic farmers. This commensal relationship between early farmers and tamed cats lasted thousands of years. As agricultural
                      practices spread, so did tame and domesticated cats.[11][6] Wildcats of Egypt contributed to the maternal gene pool of the domestic cat at a later
                      time.[45] The earliest known evidence for the occurrence of the domestic cat in Greece dates to around 1200 BC. Greek, Phoenician, Carthaginian and
                      Etruscan traders introduced domestic cats to southern Europe.[46] During the Roman Empire they were introduced to Corsica and Sardinia before the beginning
                      of the 1st millennium.[47] By the 5th century BC, they were familiar animals around settlements in Magna Graecia and Etruria.[48] By the end of the Roman
                      Empire in the 5th century, the Egyptian domestic cat lineage had arrived in a Baltic Sea port in northern Germany.[45]

                      During domestication, cats have undergone only minor changes in anatomy and behavior, and they are still capable of surviving in the wild. Several natural
                       behaviors and characteristics of wildcats may have preadapted them for domestication as pets. These traits include their small size, social nature, obvious
                        body language, love of play and relatively high intelligence. Captive Leopardus cats may also display affectionate behavior toward humans, but were not
                         domesticated.[49] House cats often mate with feral cats,[50] producing hybrids such as the Kellas cat in Scotland.[51] Hybridisation between domestic and
                          other Felinae species is also possible.[52]

                      Development of cat breeds started in the mid 19th century.[53] An analysis of the domestic cat genome revealed that the ancestral wildcat genome was
                      significantly altered in the process of domestication as specific mutations were selected to develop cat breeds.[54] Most breeds are founded on random-bred
                       domestic cats. Genetic diversity of these breeds varies between regions, and is lowest in purebred populations, which show more than 20 deleterious genetic
                        disorders.[55]</p>
           <h1 id="dog"><u>DOG</u></h1>
           <p>The dog (Canis familiaris when considered a distinct species or Canis lupus familiaris when considered a subspecies of the wolf)[5] is a member of the genus Canis
              (canines), which forms part of the wolf-like canids,[6] and is the most widely abundant terrestrial carnivore.[7][8][9][10][11] The dog and the extant gray wolf are
               sister taxa[12][13][14] as modern wolves are not closely related to the wolves that were first domesticated,[13][14] which implies that the direct ancestor of the dog
                is extinct.[15] The<span class="dog"> dog</span> was the first species to be domesticated,[14][16] and has been selectively bred over millennia for various behaviors,
                 sensory capabilities, and physical attributes.[17]</p>
           <h1 id="goat"><u>GOAT</u></h1>
           <p>The domestic goat or simply goat (Capra aegagrus hircus) is a subspecies of C. aegagrus domesticated from the wild goat of Southwest Asia and Eastern Europe. The
              goat is a member of the animal family Bovidae and the subfamily Caprinae, meaning it is closely related to the sheep. There are over 300 distinct breeds of goat.[1]
               Goats are one of the oldest domesticated species of animal, and have been used for milk, meat, fur and skins across much of the world.[2] Milk from goats is often
               turned into goat cheese.</p>
           <h1 id="donkey"><u>DONKEY</u></h1>
           <p>The donkey or ass (Equus africanus asinus)[1][2] is a domesticated member of the horse family, Equidae. The wild ancestor of the donkey is the African wild ass, E.
              africanus. The <a href="https://bijudamian.github.io/hello/hello.html">donkey</a> has been used as a working animal for at least 5000 years. There are more than 40 million donkeys in the world, mostly in underdeveloped countries,
               where they are used principally as draught or pack animals. Working donkeys are often associated with those living at or below subsistence levels. Small numbers of
               donkeys are kept for breeding or as pets in developed countries.</p>
